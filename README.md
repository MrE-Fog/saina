Saina - Image based test automation framework ready for cloud
==============================================================

The Dream
---------

Saina is a image recognition based test automation framework. Saina is primarily focussed on testing in the cloud and uses AWS. For image recognition and related features we are using sikuli and OpenCV.

The platforms that we are currently building for are 
1. Android
1. IOS
1. Blackberry
1. Windows
1. OSX
1. Linux

Using saina user can write image based UI automation test cases for the application and run them on AWS cloud. If your application has similar UI on multiple platforms you can reuse the test case on all platforms. 

Saina framework provides functionality for parallel execution of tests , results collation, log analysis and reports generation. Additionally features for load\stress testing (especially in case of applications talking to a server) will also be built. Saina will be designed and built to work with desktop applications and devices (as well as emulators\simulators ).
